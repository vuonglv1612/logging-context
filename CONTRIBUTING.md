## Making a new release(For Maintainer)

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`  

To trigger a new release all you need to do is.

1. Run the tests to ensure everything is working.
2. Run `make release` to create a new tag.
3. `git push -u origin HEAD --tags` to push it to the remote repo

The `make release` will ask you the version number to create the tag, ex: type `0.1.1` when you are asked.

> **CAUTION**:  The make release will change local changelog files and commit all the unstaged changes you have.
